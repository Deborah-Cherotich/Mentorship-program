    <h1>Born A Crime 1 & 2</h1>

        <p>
            In the book "Born a Crime" by Trevor Noah, chapter one touches on themes that resonate <br>
            with what's happening in Trans-Nzoia County currently. One of the themes that stood out <br>
            in the book is Apartheid, which exploits linguistic and tribalism, resulting in division <br>
            among communities, just like the Xhosa and Zulu. Trevor Noah comes from a mixed family <br>
            where his mother was Xhosa, and his father was a white Swiss man.

            Another theme that the book highlights is religion. Noah's mother has faith, which makes her believe <br>
            in different churches which leads her to attend three different churches every Sunday, each offering <br>
            something different. The first church offers praise, the second church offers deep analysis of the <br>
            scripture, which Trevor's mum loves the most. In Trans-Nzoia County, we have different churches that <br>
            people believe offer something different.

            In our county, there have been conflicts between drivers and passengers for various reasons. <br>
            For instance, Trevor's mother was threatened by a minibus driver which led to her being <br>
            thrown out of the car and even jumping out of a moving vehicle. Some drivers in our county <br>
            harass their passengers, speaking to them in a threatening manner, which has caused some <br>
            fatal accidents and injuries, and even resulted in loss of life.

            In chapter two of the book, we see how native people were forced to leave their land and <br>
            were subjected to slavery. They lived in constant fear, and Trevor, being the product of <br>
            a white man and a black woman, was at risk of arrest due to community laws. Despite the <br>
            crime that she committed, Trevor's mother, who worked as a typist, was courageous and <br>
            feared no one. This resonates with our county, where people from different backgrounds <br>
            have been forced to work as slaves in other communities due to poverty.

            In 2007, in Trans-Nzoia County, there was a division between the Maasai and the Luhya communities due <br>
            to social status. The Maasai started fighting the Luhya because they wanted them to migrate from the <br>
            land and leave it to them. This conflict brought out the theme of belonging, as seen in the book <br>
            "Born a Crime" where the Zulu warriors fought against the Xhosas because they felt the Xhosas had <br>
            power over them.

        </p>
        <p>
            Another theme in Trans-Nzoia County is parents' love for their children. Children are <br>
            cared for and loved by their parents who pay for their education. Similarly, Trevor's <br>
            mother loved him so much that she didn't want him to interact with other people in the <br>
            community because they could isolate him due to his being a white child.
