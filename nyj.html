            <h1>Born A Crime</h1>

            <p>
                Trevor Noah's "Born a Crime" delves into themes that hold relevance for current events in Trans-Nzoia
                County. The first chapter explores the impact of Apartheid, which leveraged linguistic and tribal
                differences to create division among communities, much like the Xhosa and Zulu. Noah's personal
                experience growing up in a mixed family, with a Xhosa mother and white Swiss father, offers a unique
                perspective on these issues.

                The book highlights a variety of themes, one of which is religion. We learn that Noah's mother is a
                woman of faith who attends three different churches every Sunday, each offering something unique. While
                the first church focuses on praise, the second church delves deep into scripture analysis, which
                Trevor's mother particularly enjoys. This portrayal of religion reminds us of the diversity of beliefs
                and practices in different regions, such as Trans-Nzoia County, where people have their own unique
                beliefs and preferences when it comes to churches.

                The second chapter of the book sheds light on the plight of indigenous people who were forced to leave
                their ancestral land and subjected to slavery. Trevor, born to a mixed-race couple, lived in constant
                fear of arrest due to discriminatory laws. However, his mother, a typist by profession, displayed
                remarkable courage and refused to cower in adversity. This narrative strikes a chord with our county,
                where poverty has forced people from diverse backgrounds to work as slaves in other communities.

                A similar theme of belonging emerged in Trans-Nzoia County in 2007 when the Maasai and Luhya communities
                clashed due to differences in social status. The Maasai wanted the Luhya to vacate the land, leading to
                a violent confrontation. This scenario mirrors the historical conflict between the Zulu and Xhosa
                tribes, as depicted in "Born a Crime," where the Zulu warriors fought against the Xhosas, believing they
                held undue power over them.
